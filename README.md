This repository contains the papers cited in the review paper [Bias and Debias in Recommender System: A Survey and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03240) and some of their implementations .To make it easier to use, there are a few points worth noting:

1. The paper links are mainly from google_scholar,most of them can be downloaded directly.But a few of the links are only directed to the homepages of the papers because of their copyrights.

2. There are two main sources of the codes for each cited papers: the github and the personal homepage of the authors for each papers.It should be noted that some of the codes are provided by the authors of the papers, while others are contributed  by some anonymous users. So, the quality of their codes has never been testify by us. What's more, just as you can see,there are some papers that lack implementations. If you found any sources of the code or if you want to contribute to them by yourself,do not hesitate to contact us. Every contribution you make would be greatly appreciated.

If you find our project useful,please cite the paper [Bias and Debias in Recommender System: A Survey and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03240) and star this repository.
